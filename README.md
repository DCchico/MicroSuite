µSuite: A Benchmark Suite for Microservices

µSuite is a suite of OLDI services that are each composed of front-end, mid-tier, and leaf microservice tiers. μSuite includes four OLDI services that incorporate open-source software: a content-based high dimensional search for image similarity — HDSearch, a replication-based protocol router for scaling fault-tolerant key-value stores — Router, a service for performing set algebra on posting lists for document retrieval — Set Algebra, and a user-based item recommender system for predicting user ratings — Recommend.
µSuite was originally written to evaluate OS and network overheads faced by microservices. You can find more details about µSuite in our IISWC paper [a link] (http://akshithasriraman.eecs.umich.edu/pubs/IISWC2018-%CE%BCSuite-preprint.pdf).
